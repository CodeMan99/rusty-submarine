# Rusty Submarine

CodeMan99's rust playground.

## Why

Rust is awesome. I must learn Rust. The raw number of compilation targets is awesome. I want Rust super powers.

## Usage

This project includes a [devcontainer](https://containers.dev). Get started with [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), the remote development [extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), and [docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Then clone the repository using the [Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-a-git-repository-or-github-pr-in-an-isolated-container-volume) command. After the devcontainer is ready, run `sqlx database create` to initialize postgres. Finally, run `cargo build` to create the application binary.
